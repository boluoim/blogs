As a frontend developer, I recently switched to Plausible Analytics because I wanted a simple, privacy-focused alternative to Google Analytics that I could self-host. After some exploration, I found that deploying it with Dokploy was surprisingly straightforward, even for someone like me who isn't too familiar with DevOps.

In this tutorial, I'm going to share my setup process, showing you how I self-host Plausible using Dokploy. I've broken down all the steps I took, from initial setup to final deployment, making it easy for you to follow along.

## Prerequisites

Here's what I used for this setup:

* A VPS from [Hostinger](https://hostinger.com?REFERRALCODE=B7YFRYANENG1) (though any VPS provider would work)
    
* [Dokploy](https://dokploy.com/) account - my choice for managing server deployment effortlessly
    
* [Plausible](https://plausible.io/) Analytics - the privacy-friendly analytics tool I'll be deploying
    

I'll walk through how I set up each of these tools as we go. Let's dive in!
